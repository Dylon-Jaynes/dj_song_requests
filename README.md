## Description
This app is part one of two apps that I am currently developing for my Father's DJ Business "Jaybay DJ Entertainment". This app (business version) will allow DJ's to seamlessly receive and manage song requests at events. The app contains a splash screen followed by a custom Onboarding section. There are setup pages and a main page for managing song requests. This app follows MVVM Architecture to the best of my understanding and uses Navigation Components to navigate through the apps Fragments using only one Activity as the controller. The app will implement a Firestore Realtime Database to manage data between business versions and client versions of the app.
